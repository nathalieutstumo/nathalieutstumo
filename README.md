### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UX-Design student who loves being creative. I have previously studied two years of front-end development.  

I'm 22 years old, study at Noroff in Oslo and plan to start working the summer of 2023, when I'm done with my studies.

As of right now all I have done are school projects, but I look forward to develope both pet-projects and sites for others in the future.
